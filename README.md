# Face-Detection
Real life emoji mapping technique
Facemoji is a real-time face detection and tracking concept.
It uses computer vision to identify facial landmarks like eyes, mouth, and eyebrows.
These detected points are mapped dynamically as the person moves.
Emojis or custom graphics are overlaid on corresponding facial features.
The system updates in real time to reflect changes in expression or angle.
It combines facial recognition, AR, and motion tracking technologies.
Applications include video chats, streaming, and entertainment filters.
Facemoji brings digital expressions to life with playful, interactive visuals.
